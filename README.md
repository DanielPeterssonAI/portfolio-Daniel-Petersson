# Daniel Petersson

I have always been a bit of a computer nerd, starting out with hardware and overclocking in the early 2000's, transitioning more and more towards software and programming. I have been using JavaScript a fair bit in my spare time, I just like the syntax and how easy it is getting visual results in canvas.

Well idk what to write but I this is my portfolio of Python projects. I might upload some JavaScript fun here later. 

Basically I'm just a beginner in this huge world of data and algos. This GitHub thing actually seems like pretty cool thing.
